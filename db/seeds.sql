Not only am I a nerd, but I’ve starred in movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as a Norse God. I have access to a bunch of the movie props and you could possibly meet some of my other MCU friends if we were to date. Born in Australia, I also love to do non-nerdy things, such as surfing and jogging on the beach. I am not your typical nerd, but I do dress up pretty often."),
("Lyndsey Scott", "BeautywithBrains", "https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D1t7PZMU8AEhrR2.jpg", "I am an American model, who would like to turn around the stereotype that all models are just looks with no brains. As Calvin Klein’s first African-American exclusive model, I feel I have a lot to offer. I am one of the top iOS responders on Stack Overflow and have done tutorial videos for children with other well-known coders, such as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. My love for coding started at the age of 12 and I can code in various languages, some of them: Java, C++, Python, Objective C, and iOS. My dream is to inspire other young girls to get into software development and enter the field."),
("Grace Hopper", "NavyRulesArmyDr00l$", "https://www.engineerbabu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/grace-hopper-3-600x403-1.jpg", "I am an American computer scientist and Navy rear admiral. Due to my popularization of machine-independent programming languages, the development of COBOL was started. I also have my PhD in mathematics from Yale and was a mathematics professor. I always believed that programming in the English language was possible, so I built a compiler that converted English terms into machine code that is understood by computers. I also love to take things apart, to see how they work from the inside."),
("Natalie Portman", "TheProfessionalNerd", "http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/41600000/Natalie-Portman-natalie-portman-41650501-767-767.jpg", "You may not think of me as a nerd, being an American actress in so many movies. However, I have starred in the Star Wars franchise when I was only in high school and even missed the premiere of the movie to study for my finals. I also have attended Harvard, because I think education is important. I have also starred in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, making it so I have been in many nerdy universes. Animal rights and the environment are two of my current causes that I love to support."),
("Frances Elizabeth “Fran” Allen", "IBMfellowLady", "https://www.berkeley.edu/news/berkeleyan/2008/01/images/franallen1.jpg", "I am an American computer scientist and known for being a pioneer in optimizing compilers. I am also the first female IBM Fellow and the first woman to win the Turing award. I grew up on a farm, so I am really good with animals. However, I also have a background in teaching, so I am really good with kids also. Some of my other achievements include having my degree in mathematics, which helped me to lay down the groundwork for automatic program optimization technology.");
