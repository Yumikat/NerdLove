# NerdLove (aka IT Crowd)

# Overview
Project2 was a team project composed of Alex, Nikki, Pidchaya, Robby, and Yulia (we can be found on the collaborators listing). Our project is called IT Crowd and is an app that will find a development tutor for the user. The user enters basic information about themselves and what they're looking for in a tutor, and the result will be the best match from a database of other programmers. It's also a sort of trade of skills, because the user can offer to tutor another user in a language they know.
